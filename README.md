# powerlifting-eda

Jupyter notebook that runs some exploratory data analysis on a dataset that I prevoisly cleaned up. The notebook explains each step and function. 

## Installation

Currently there is no special virtual environment for this project. In the future I would like to recreate it and add a requirements.txt file.
