# powerlifting-eda

This Jupyter notebook picks up from a previous project: https://github.com/AlbertUlysses/Clean_data . It runs exploratory data analysis on the dataset. The notebook explains each step and function used. 

## Installation

Currently there is no special virtual environment for this project. In the future I would like to recreate it and add a requirements.txt file.
